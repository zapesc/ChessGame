This is an online multiplayer chess game, and includes files for both client and servers.

To use the application, install the files from the repository.

As a player, run main.py from the terminal. The application will prompt for the address of the server. If left blank, this will default to localhost on port 4000. You can also input a username, which will be assigned to you if available. If left blank, a Guest username will be given. After connecting to the server, you will be prompted to input a user to play against. If left blank, the Server will pair you against a waiting opponent. 

To run the application as a server, run Server.py from the terminal. Defaults to listening from all addresses on port 4000.
